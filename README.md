# Schema Pro - Genesis (THIS PLUGIN IS NOW ARCHIVED!!! )

## This plugin doesn't work with the latest version of WP Schema Pro!

We recommend you use Bill Erickson's [Disable Genesis Schema](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-genesis-schema/) plugin instead. It's probably better to remove ALL schema from Genesis if you're relying on WP Schema Pro to handle JSON schema output.
